URL Shorterner Project -- Converts long webpage addresses into shorter links.

To run the code, download the "URL-Shorterner" folder, containing the server.js file and an index.ejs file. The server.js file contains code that runs the server, and outlines the paths of the server, such as /hello and /shorten. The index.ejs file allows /shorten to view the html code inside and loads up the html webpage.

Open the folder with VSCode, and in the terminal, use the command: npm run devStart

Then, in your browser, go to localhost:3000, localhost:3000/hello, or localhost:3000/shorten.
