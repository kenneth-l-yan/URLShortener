URL Shorterner Project -- Converts long webpage addresses into shorter links.

To use, download the "url-shorterner" folder, containing server.js, index.ejs, and other files. The server.js file contains code that runs the server, and outlines the paths of the server, such as /hello and /shorten. The index.ejs file allows /shorten to view the html code inside and renders the html webpage.

Open the folder with VSCode or any code editor. In the terminal, use the command "npm run devStart" to start the server. By default, the server is hosted on port 3000.

In a browser, go to localhost:3000 to load up the server. You may nagivate to the different paths (localhost:3000/hello, localhost:3000/shorten).
