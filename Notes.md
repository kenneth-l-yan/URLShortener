## URL Shortener Notes

**Overview**

The problem: Long URLs are too long, messy, and hard to remember.

Our solution: Take any long URL input from the user and output a shorter URL that's easier to remember.


**Mapping**
- The short url and long url should take you to the same website.
- Alius: A shorter way of referring to an item.
  - Ex. Short url is an *alius* (a "nickname") of the long url; both refer to the same website.

Potential scenarios for mapping:
  1. One to one (1 short url <--> 1 long url)
  2. Many to one (Many short urls <--> 1 long url)
  3. One to many (1 short url <--> Many long urls)

Let's explore each scenario in more detail.

  1. One short url mapped to one long url.
